Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on building systems that can learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. 
ML is widely used in various fields such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce for predictive analytics, automation, and decision-making.
